# shoe-shape
This is an open source application that aims to take foot measurements for custom shoe manufacturing. Through the ARKit libraries, it allows the user to make a foot scam and send the measurements to a shoemaker to manufacture. This project uses Swift-UI, Combine and Observation for reactive layers. Redux as architecture.
